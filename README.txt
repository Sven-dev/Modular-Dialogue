# Modular Dialogue!

A Unity-based C# System for dialogue and other types of text.

# How does it work?
Currently the system has a base conversation gameobject, which executes all dialogue components underneath itself.
The dialogue options so far are:
- Standard textbox.
- 2-button choice.
- Conversation end.

First you add the code to your Unity Project. I've prepared a few prefabs in the 'Components' folder, as well as a full conversation as a demonstration.

# Custom dialogue components?
All dialogue options consist of modular components, which allow you to construct your own dialogue options and easily add new possibilities if need be.
